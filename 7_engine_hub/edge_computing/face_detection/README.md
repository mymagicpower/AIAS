# AIAS & DJL Android Demo

# Introduction

In this example, you learn how to implement inference code with a pytorch model to detect faces in an image.

Lightweight model:
The model github can be found at [Ultra-Light-Fast-Generic-Face-Detector-1MB](https://github.com/Linzaer/Ultra-Light-Fast-Generic-Face-Detector-1MB).

## Face Detection

Sample 1                     |  Sample 2

The minimum API level for this project is 26.

### Setup

Use the following command to install this app on your Android phone:

```
cd face_detection

# for Linux/macOS
./gradlew iD

# for Windows
..\gradlew iD
```

It will install the application your Android phone.
